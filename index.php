Hello Team,

With respect to my Insurance certificate number : OG-17-1000-6609-00504101, 

I have made a purchase of Sony television Model Number : KLV 32W512D IN5 18769001 on 17th of September 2016 which covers a Standard Warranty of One year only whereas in my policy it has been updated as 2 years and my CPP Asset Care Warranty starts only from 17th of Sepetember 2018 instead 17th of Sepetember 2017.

I fear if something happens to my product this year I have no insurance covered so I kindly request you to update my policy details accordingly as,

Ext. Warranty Start Date : 17-Sept-2017
Ext. Warranty End Date   : 16-Sept-2020


For your reference, I have attached the Warranty Card attested by the Authorized dealer of Sony with this mail.

Many Thanks,
